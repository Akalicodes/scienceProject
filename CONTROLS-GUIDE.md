## 📚 Study Features

### PMAT Mnemonic
**"People Meet At Timmies"** ☕

Remember the phases:
- **P** = Prophase (chromosomes condense & pair up)
- **M** = Metaphase (chromosomes line up in middle)
- **A** = Anaphase (chromosomes are pulled apart)
- **T** = Telophase (cells start to divide)

💡 **Pro Tip:** This happens TWICE in meiosis!
- First round: PMAT I (separates homologous pairs)
- Second round: PMAT II (separates sister chromatids)
